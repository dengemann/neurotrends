neurotrends
============

NeuroTrends is a collection of tools for identifying, downloading, and analyzing published research articles. Given a PubMed query, NeuroTrends can find research articles, download HTML and PDF download, extract text from PDFs, find arbitrarily complex patterns in text samples, and visualize results.

NeuroTrends plotting functions require R and the rpy2 library in Python for visualization. The current version of the NeuroTrends database and sample visualizations are available <a href="http://neurotrends.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
