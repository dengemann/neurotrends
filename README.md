neurotrends
============

NeuroTrends is a collection of tools for identifying, downloading, and analyzing published research articles. Given a PubMed query, NeuroTrends can find research articles, download HTML and PDF copies, extract text from PDFs, find arbitrarily complex patterns in text samples, and visualize results.

NeuroTrends requires R and the rpy2 library in Python for visualization.
